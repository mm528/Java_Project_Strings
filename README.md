# Java_Project_Strings
A small exercise of a Java project for Strings

A given exercise may take a junior software developer exam in a Java document.  
This is an example of a job exercise practice test, and I had to re-do 
the test to help see if any mistake happened. 

The tools i use for this exercise are:
RegEx library
ArrayList
StringBuffer
