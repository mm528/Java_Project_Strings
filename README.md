# Java_Project_Strings
A small exercise of a Java project for Strings

A given exercise may take a junior software developer exam in a Java document.  
This is an example of a job exercise practice test, and I had to re-do 
the test to help see if any mistake happened. 
The test is:

if a string is given such as: abcdMopNo whereas the char is a capital M the previous 
2 texts needs to increase by and wherenever is N then the next 2 char needs to delete from the word.

Example: abcdMopNo
Solution: abcddop
The tools i use for this exercise are:
RegEx library
ArrayList
StringBuffer
